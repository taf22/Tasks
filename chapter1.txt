Elara traced the shimmering paths on the map with her fingertip, noting strange symbols and winding trails that didn’t match anything she’d seen before. At the bottom corner, etched in silver script, were the words: “Only the seeker may walk the unseen path.” The map pulsed faintly, as if alive, guiding her gaze to a cluster of trees marked with a glowing rune—trees she’d seen once at the forest’s edge.

That night, Elara packed a small satchel with a lantern, bread, and her father’s old compass. She crept out of the cottage while the moon watched silently overhead. Her heart thumped wildly, but her resolve was firm. With the map clutched tightly, she stepped into the Whispering Woods, the trees welcoming her with a breeze that almost sounded like a whisper: Welcome, seeker.
