The Whispering Woods Chronicle
On the edge of the quiet village of Elderglen, where mist curled like ribbons between the trees and the wind carried secrets through the leaves, young Elen stumbled upon a brittle scroll hidden beneath the roots of an ancient oak. The map was etched in silver ink that shimmered faintly under moonlight, its paths winding deep into the forbidden Whispering Woods â€” a place no villager dared enter since the old tales of vanishings and ghostly murmurs. Heart pounding and curiosity ablaze, Elen knew the moment she unfurled the parchment that her life was about to change forever.
